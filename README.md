# 📚 DSA Practice Collection

This repo is a personal collection of solved **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems — organized topic-wise for easy access and revision.

You'll find implementations of:

- 📌 **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- 🌳 **Trees** (Binary Trees, BSTs, traversals, etc.)
- 🔗 **Graphs** (BFS, DFS, MSTs, etc.)
- 📥 **Stacks & Queues** (Static and Dynamic, Priority Queue etc)
- 🔐 **Hashing** (Linear and Quadratic Probing)

Most problems are inspired by platforms like **GeeksforGeeks** and also include basic core implementation code of each topic to understand the concept from scratch.


Great for:
- Quick brushing up
- Understanding core logic
- Referencing while solving problems
